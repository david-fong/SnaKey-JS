# SnaKey

This a game I came up with over the reading break (2018).

It was first made in Python: https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey.

I wanted to make it more accessible, and also to learn some new skills, so I decided to try porting it over to JavaScript.

I hope that it can help people to practice typing in english and to recognizing characters in other languages (and to have fun at the same time! (Although I'm aware that not everyone is into this kind of speed-typing thing)).
