# [SnaKey](https://david-fong.github.io/SnaKey-JS "click to play!")

This a game I came up with over the reading break (2018).

It was first made in Python: https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey.

I wanted to make it more accessible, and also to learn some new skills, so I decided to try porting it over to JavaScript.

My hopes for this project: I hope that it can help people to practice typing in english, and to recognize characters in other languages while having fun at the same time (Although I'm aware that not everyone is into typing games).

The music for this game is also my own work. Fun fact: I wrote it in 13/8 time with chord changes every two measures, which makes for 26 beats per chord-change! (as many letters as there are in the alphabet) You can find more of my musical work on my youtube channel.
