# [SnaKey](https://david-fong.github.io/SnaKey-JS "click to play!")

This a game I came up with over the reading break (2018).

It was first made in Python: https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey.

I wanted to make it more accessible, and also to learn some new skills, so I decided to try porting it over to JavaScript.

I hope that it can help people to practice typing in english, and to recognize characters in other languages while having fun at the same time (Although I'm aware that not everyone is into typing games).
