# [SnaKey](https://david-fong.github.io/SnaKey-JS "click to play!")

This is a game I came up with over the reading break of 2018. I first [wrote it in Python](https://github.com/david-fong/SnaKey), but in an effort to make my idea easy to access and to improve myself, I decided to learn Javascript and port it over.

I hope my game can help people to practice typing in english, and to recognize characters in other languages while having fun at the same time (Although I'm aware that not everyone is into typing games).

The music in this game is also my own work. I wrote it in 13/8 time with chord changes every two measures to play on the typing theme, since that makes 26 beats per chord (one for each letter of the alphabet). You can find more of my musical work on my youtube channel.
