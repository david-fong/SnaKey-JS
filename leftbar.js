// Tutorial:
/*
0. Type the key for an adjacent tile to move.
1. Mouse-over a tile to check what to type.
2. You can also move in diagonals!

3. Eat targets to increase your score.
4. The game ends when the chaser catches you.
5. The chaser speeds up based on your score.
   (And also how many targets you've missed)

7. Misses come from targets eaten by the nommer.
8. The nommer cannot attack you. It doesn't bite.
9. Misses make the game more difficult
   without improving your final score.

10. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way
   to cut down your misses? (*there is)
11. If you catch (go right beside) the runner,
   your misses will be cut down by a third.

12. If you find the game too easy, press the
   spice button to boost the chaser's speed.
